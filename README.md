# RyseInventory Support ![](https://i.imgur.com/BS3gwxL.png)

This Discord bot is currently under development. One of the purposes of this bot is to make it easier for the users of
[RyseInventory](https://github.com/Rysefoxx/RyseInventory) can report bugs more easily. Also implemented is a ticket
system, which makes it possible to create a ticket for questions
to create a ticket which will be answered by a team member. Furthermore, player requests are highly regarded. Also for
this
there is a function to create your idea via bot. This idea ends up first with the developer and then
in a public chat for voting.
